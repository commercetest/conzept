====== datasources ======

(TODO: Document how the datasources system works and how it can be configured. Show the steps for a simple datasource integration.)


The idea is to **allow any REST or SPARQL API to be added to a Conzept system** and render topics in the sidebar.

Features:
  * Make adding a new datasource as easy as possible, but still flexible in terms of the rendered output.
  * Make the API search results show up in the same style and results paging mechanics, as the other datasources.
  * Let the topic results be augmented from Wikidata (if a Qid is provided for the topic).
  * Have auto-completion work too (if wanted and possible).
  * Allow the user to choose which datasources to use.

===== use cases =====

  * **Allow for adding extra "data sources" to a Conzept system**, so other concepts - beyond Wikipedia and Wikidata - can also be presented.
  *  **Any organization that wants to use the Conzept user-interface for showing and augmenting their own knowledge base.**

===== status =====

[{{::datasources.png?direct|datasource options for the user}}]

  * The **[[datasources]]** system is now working (configuration example: **[[https://conze.pt/app/explore2/src/data/datasources.js|src/data/datasources.js]]**) and has been tested with various datasources (with REST and SPARQL access).

  * See: **[[issues#datasources|datasource issues]]**.

  * Future improvements:
    * **Add global search options** like: **sort-key** (relevance, date-asc, date-desc) and **media-types filter** (text, image, audio, video, 3d, etc.).
    * Indicate when a datasource is "unreachable".
    * Add hooks for pre- and post-processing of the API data.
    * Add hooks to enrich the API data (with Wikipedia and Wikidata information)
    * Research support for self-hosted, data files used as a datasource: JSON, Parquet, CSV, RDF

===== adding a new datasource =====

  - Add the new datasource to the datasource-configuration file here: [[https://conze.pt/app/explore2/src/data/datasources.js|src/data/datasources.js]]
  - Add a new datasource directory (using the name of the datasource, eg. "gleif")
  - Add a new JS file in that directory, implementing the required API access functions, example: [[https://conze.pt/app/explore2/src/datasources/gleif/index.js|src/datasources/gleif/index.js]]
