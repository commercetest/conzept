====== datasources ======

[{{::datasources.png?direct|Conze.pt encyclopedic showcase of datasource options}}]

The Conzept datasource system **allows any REST or SPARQL API to be added to a Conzept system** and render topics in the sidebar.

User benefits:
  * Allow the user to choose which datasources to use.
  * Have auto-completion work too (if wanted and possible).
  * Make the API search results show in the same style and results-paging mechanics.
  * Let the topic results be augmented from Wikidata (if a Qid is provided for the topic).

Developer benefits:
  * Makes adding new datasources simple and quick, but still flexible in terms of the rendered output.

===== use cases =====

  * **Allow for adding extra "data sources" to a Conzept system**, so other concepts - beyond Wikipedia and Wikidata - can also be presented.
  *  **Any organization that wants to use the Conzept user-interface for showing and augmenting their own knowledge base.**

===== adding a new datasource =====

  - Add the new datasource to the datasource-configuration file here: [[https://conze.pt/app/explore2/src/data/datasources.js|src/data/datasources.js]]
  - Add a new datasource directory (using the name of the datasource, eg. "gleif")
  - Add a new JS file in that directory, implementing the required API access functions, example: [[https://conze.pt/app/explore2/src/datasources/gleif/index.js|src/datasources/gleif/index.js]]
