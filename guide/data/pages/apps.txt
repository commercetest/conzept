====== apps ======

Conzept allows **internal URLs** (self-hosted) and [[explore>Cross-origin resource sharing|CORS-enabled]] **external URLs** to be rendered into the [[user_manual#content_panes|content area]].

The internal URLs are used for **[[used_projects#embedded_apps|embedding apps]]**. There are currently about 40 of such apps.

Below is an overview of the most relevant apps.

===== wikidata app =====

[{{::wikidata_app.jpg?direct|[[https://conze.pt/explore/Hyacinth%20(plant)?l=en&t=link&i=Q158758&u=%2Fapp%2Fwikidata%2F%3Fq%3DQ158758%26lang%3Den%26lang3%3Deng&s=true|example]]}}]

This app renders the content from Wikidata in a form better optimized for reading.

From here you can also go to the Wikidata source page (eg. to make edits), by clicking the <html>&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>&nbsp;</html> icon.

===== video app =====

[{{::video_app.jpg?direct|[[https://conze.pt/explore/John%20Coltrane?l=en&t=link&i=Q7346&u=%2Fapp%2Fvideo%2F%23%2Fsearch%2F%22John%20Coltrane%22&s=true|example]]}}]

The video app renders the content from YouTube  into Conzept in a more minimal style.

There are options to filter the video by: duration, resolution and type.

You can also sort the videos by: relevance, date and number of views.

Youtube API access is kindly being provided for free by [[explore>Google]] to the Conze.pt website. Thank you!

=====  tree app =====

[{{::tree_app.jpg?direct|[[https://conze.pt/explore/Frederick%20Douglass?l=en&t=link-split&i=Q215562&u=%2Fapp%2Ftree%2Fen%2Ffamily_tree%2FQ215562&s=true#|example]]}}]

With the tree app you can see the relations to and from a topic in the form of a zoomable tree structure.

These relations can be:
  * [[https://conze.pt/explore/Cosimo%20de'%20Medici?l=en&t=link-split&i=Q48544&u=%2Fapp%2Ftree%2Fen%2Ffamily_tree%2FQ48544&s=true#|family]]

===== links app =====

[{{ ::links_app.jpg?direct|[[https://conze.pt/explore/Pythagorean%20theorem?l=en&t=link-split&i=Q11518&u=%2Fapp%2Flinks%2F%3Fl%3Den%26t%3DPythagorean%2520theorem&s=true|example]] }}]

This links-app renders the the first 20 links of a Wikipedia-article into a zoomable, interactive graph view.

It allows you to explore the essential relations of a topic in a more visual form.

===== map app =====

[{{::map_app_1.jpg?direct|map example of a location (with an opened infobox)}}]

[{{::map_app_3.jpg?direct|map example of a location with a border outline}}]

[{{::map_app_2.jpg?direct|map example created from the UI showing two different data-set instances (rune stones and stave churches)}}]

The map app can render locations and areas on a 3D terrain map of Earth.

The map app can also render the results coming from a SPARQL-query constructed by adding geo-type topics to a map-query list. To add such a geo-type go to the "meta"-section of a topic and click on the <html><i class="fas fa-plus"></i></html> "compare map" button.

===== nearby map app =====

[{{::nearby_app.jpg?direct|[[https://conze.pt/explore/Qeysarie%20Gate?l=en&t=link-split&i=Q5871275&u=https%3A%2F%2Fconze.pt%2Fapp%2Fnearby%2F%23lat%3D32.660369%26lng%3D51.676797%26zoom%3D17%26interface_language%3Den%26layers%3Dwikidata_image%2Cwikidata_no_image%2Cwikipedia&c=32.660369,51.676797&s=true|example]]}}]

This app helps you see the nearby points of interest for topics with a geo-location. As you pan the map new points of interest are shown.

===== time-space app =====

[{{ ::content_panes_2_mark.jpg?direct|[[https://conze.pt/explore/Thirty%20Years'%20War?l=en&t=link-split&i=Q2487&u=https%3A%2F%2Fconze.pt%2Fapp%2Ftimespace%2F%3Fq%3DQ2487%26l%3Den%26highlight%3DQ2487%26limited%3Dfalse&s=true|example]] }}]

The time-space app allows you to view "//series of related events//", both in the time dimension as well as the spatial dimension.

===== timeline app =====

The timeline app also allows you to view events / creations / etc, both in the time dimension as well as the spatial dimension.

Note: The timeline app has more of a focus on the "//map locations//" compared to the time-space app, which focuses more on the "//series of related events//".

===== commons images =====

View the images on Wikimedia Commons using a SPARQL-query (or via a single Wikidata Qid - using the similar "commons-qid" app).

===== image viewer component =====

[{{::common_image_viewer_app_001.jpg?direct|}}]

This is the standard image viewing component (based on [[https://github.com/LCweb-ita/LC-Lightbox-LITE|LC Lightbox]]) used in several embedded apps (Wikipedia, Commons-SPARQL and others), to view image files.

The common image viewer has various advanced features:
  * Gallery thumbnails
  * Gallery slideshow
  * Image zoom and panning
  * Color palette detection
  * Interactive image filters
  * Reverse image-search (via Bing Images)
  * Monocular image-depth estimation, using browser-based AI (this turns a 2D image into a semi-3D scene)

===== IIIF image viewer =====

[{{::iiif_image_viewer_app_001.jpg?direct|[[https://conze.pt/explore/Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer,%20Drawings%20p88%20Knight%20in%20Armour?l=de&ds=culture&t=string&batchsize=5&theme=lattice&s=true#|example]]}}]

This app allows for viewing zoomable IIIF files. Conzept also supports auto-creating a IIIF with metadata from an image.

===== filter-browse app =====

[{{::filter_browse_app.jpg?direct|[[https://conze.pt/explore/Business?l=en&t=link-split&i=Q4830453&u=https%3A%2F%2Fconze.pt%2Fapp%2Fbrowse%2F%3Fc%3DQ4830453%26lang%3Den&s=true|example]]}}]

The filter-browse app allows you to drill-down on classes of Wikidata properties.

(Note: only available if some "[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P1963|properties-for-this-type]]" were defined for the entity in Wikidata.)

===== PDF speaker app =====

[{{::pdf_speaker_app_001.jpg?direct|[[https://conze.pt/explore/Demonstration%20of%20Fully%20Nonlinear%20Spectrum%20Modulated%20System%20in%20the%20Highly%20%20Nonlinear%20Optical%20Transmission%20Regime?l=en&ds=science&t=link&u=%2Fapp%2Fpdf-speaker%2Findex.html%3Fl%3Den%26voice_code%3Den-US%26voice_name%3Dundefined%26voice_rate%3D1%26voice_pitch%3D1%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fconze.pt%2Fapp%2Fcors%2Fraw%2F%3Furl%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fpdf%2F1611.08420v1&theme=lattice&s=true#|example]]}}]

This app allow you listen to the text of the PDF-file using the browser Text-to-Speech function.
The highlighted word shows which words is currently being spoken (Note: the word-speech alignment can sometimes be a bit out of sync).

You can change the voice-settings from the Conzept settings-menu.

===== compare app =====

[{{::compare_app.jpg?direct|[[https://conze.pt/explore/?l=en&t=compare&s=true&c=Q1268064,Q998535,Q1268477|example]] }}]

The compare app allows you to see the Wikidata property differences between a user-selected set of topics.

This tool works best if the topics in your selection are similar to each other.

You can add a new topic by clicking the <html><i class="fas fa-plus"></i></html> "compare table" link in the meta-section of each topic.

You can remove the compare topics, from within the compare-app, by clicking the <html><i class="far fa-times-circle"></i></html> icon at the top of each column or remove them all at once by clicking the <html><i class="fas fa-trash"></i></html> icon in the app's menu-bar.
===== organism occurrence map =====

[{{::occurence_map_app.jpg?direct|[[https://conze.pt/explore/American%20alligator?l=en&d=wikipedia,wikidata&t=link&i=Q193327&u=%2Fapp%2Fresponse%2Fgbif-map.php%3Fl%3Den%26t%3DAmerican%252520alligator%26id%3D2441370&s=true#|example]]}}]

The occurrence app shows the organism observations collected by the [[explore>Global Biodiversity Information Facility|]].

The app also allows you to select extra map overlays (such as: country borders, 30-year mean temperature, average precipitation, and more).

The app is also rendered as an web-component in Wikipedia articles relating to organism (in the "occurrence map" section).
===== inline: category tree =====
[{{::category_tree.jpg?direct|[[https://conze.pt/explore/Uganda?l=en&t=wikipedia&f=category_tree&s=true|example]] (fix link) }}]

This is a [[terms#topic_card|topic card]] widget available for topics with a category in Wikipedia. It allows you to browse the category-tree related to that topic.

All the sub-categories can be explored and the pages within each sub-category can be viewed.

Each page in a category has a menu-bar with buttons to:

  * Explore the topic further. \\ \\ 
  * Read the Wikipedia article. \\ \\
  * Find related video, audio, images and books.
