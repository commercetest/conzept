===== introduction =====

**[[https://conze.pt|Conzept]] is an attempt to create a flexible topic exploration system for the 21st century.** It is a flexible, multi-lingual, semantic web tool build for **fun, education and research purposes**.

Main features:
  * Use any set of REST and SPARQL API based **[[datasources|datasource]]**. (Note: The SPARQL-endpoint needs to support full-text search)
  * Easily embed web **[[used_projects|apps]]** and **[[field customization|links]]**, either self-hosted or remotely hosted.
  * A **[[field_customization|data-defined]] software approach**, which allows for easy JSON-based configuration and administration of many parts of Conzept, such as the [[terms#topic_card|topic-card]] content.

The Conzept project is [[explore>free software]], licensed under the [[https://github.com/waldenn/conzept/blob/master/LICENSE|GNU General Public License version 3]] (unless noted otherwise in parts of the code and assets).

The development repository is hosted on **[[https://github.com/waldenn/conzept/|GitHub]]**. Project news is announced on **[[https://twitter.com/conzept__|Twitter]]**.

[{{::explore-screenshot-011.jpg?direct|search results page}}]

The online Conzept showcase called "**Conzept encyclopedia**" is based on based on: [[explore>Wikipedia]], [[explore>Wikidata]], the [[explore>Open Library]], [[explore>Archive.org]], [[explore>YouTube]], the [[explore>Global Biodiversity Information Facility|GBIF]] and many other information sources. A [[explore>semantic web]] app build for [[explore>fun]], [[explore>education]] and [[explore>research]].

Conzept encyclopedia allows you to explore any of the millions of topics on Wikipedia (and topics from other [[datasources]]) from many [[terms#topic_sections|different angles]], such as: science, art, digital books and education, both as a defined semantic entity (a "thing") as well as a "string".

Client-side [[topic classification|topic-classification]] in addition, allows for a fast, higher-level semantic logic, throughout the whole user experience. The user-interface supports any of the ~[[explore>List of Wikipedias|300 Wikipedia languages]] and even some language-variants (such as the Chinese language variants).

===== project goals =====

{{ :logo.svg?200}}

Although Wikipedia is great and getting better all the time, I (Jama Poulsen) felt that the encyclopedic information could be presented better and have more integration with other major sources of information on the web.

Each Wikipedia "article" actually relates to a multi-faceted concept, which we ideally should be able to easily explore. This is what Conzept strives to be a good tool for. To help anyone to explore and learn about topics of their interest, in an effective and enjoyable way.

The main goals of Conzept are:

  * A more **holistic presentation of the information** contained within [[datasources]] (such as Wikipedia and Wikidata), by integrating and linking with other information sources, semantic entities and application views. Aiming to allow you to 'forget' where the information is coming from and instead explore //that// which you are interested in.

  * Significantly **improving the user experience** when taking in that wealth of information, by trying to reduce various cognitive-loads such as "website context-switching" (see eg. [[https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2021/may/overcoming-tab-overload.html|tab overload]], relational discovery and understanding, topic revisiting and topic actions using bookmarks), and making the experience as fun and inspiring as possible.

  * **Innovate** where that is both possible and useful, based on [[https://conze.pt/explore/Human-centered%20design?l=en&t=wikipedia|human-centered design]] principles. This project is an ever-evolving tool, within an increasingly digital, connected world of people and their creative works. 

  * Build the project as **free software** and make its use and development accessible for all. Keep it free of advertising, but find sustainable ways to support its maintenance, development and collaboration. One way to support this project is to become a [[https://github.com/sponsors/waldenn|GitHub sponsor]].


Secondary goals:

  * **Generalize the UI and data-processes**, to expand beyond the Wikipedia & Wikidata spheres, using flexible [[datasources]]. This opens the way for other digital archives to also use the Conzept system for their knowledge base and domain.

  * Allow for **social learning** (using eg. peer-to-peer audio-chat rooms for each topic). Doing things together can be more motivating, inspiring and fun!

  * Use the idea of **5D information exploration**:
    * 3D for the **spatial domain** (X,Y,Z positions for [[https://conze.pt/explore/Roller%20coaster?l=en&t=link-split&i=Q204832&u=%2Fapp%2Fquery%2Fembed.html%3Fl%3Den%23SELECT%252520DISTINCT%252520%25253Fitem%252520%25253FitemLabel%252520%25253FitemDescription%252520%25253Fimg%252520%25253Fgeoshape%252520%25253Fcoords%252520WHERE%252520%25257B%25250A%252520%252520%25253Fitem%252520wdt%25253AP31%252520wd%25253AQ204832.%25250A%252520%252520OPTIONAL%252520%25257B%252520%25253Fitem%252520wdt%25253AP625%252520%25253Fcoords.%252520%25257D%25250A%252520%252520optional%252520%25257B%25253Fitem%252520wdt%25253AP3896%252520%25253Fgeoshape%252520.%25257D%25250A%252520%252520OPTIONAL%252520%25257B%252520%25253Fitem%252520wdt%25253AP18%252520%25253Fimg.%252520%25257D%25250A%252520%252520SERVICE%252520wikibase%25253Alabel%252520%25257B%252520bd%25253AserviceParam%252520wikibase%25253Alanguage%252520%252522en%25252Cen%252522.%252520%25257D%25250A%25257D%25250AORDER%252520BY%252520(%25253FitemLabel)%25250ALIMIT%2525205000%25250A%252523meta%25253A%252520Roller%2520coaster%252520%252523defaultView%25253AMap%25257B%252522hide%252522%25253A%252520%252522%25253Fcoords%252522%25257D&s=true#|points]], [[https://conze.pt/explore/A2%20road%20(England)?l=en&d=wikipedia,wikidata&t=link&i=Q888603&u=%2Fapp%2Foverpass%2Fmap.html%3FQ%3D%25255Bout%25253Ajson%25255D%25255Btimeout%25253A25%25255D%25253B%25250A(%25250A%252520%252520relation(13047412)%25253B%25250A)%25253B%25250Aout%252520body%25253B%25250A%3E%25253B%25250Aout%252520skel%252520qt%25253B%25250A&c=51.3768,0.5403&s=true#|lines]].

===== inspiration & motivation =====

Some points of inspiration for this project were:
  * A Dutch youth encyclopedia I enjoyed reading when I was a child. [{{ :spectrum_jeugd_encyclopedie.jpg?direct|Dutch youth encyclopedia}}]

  * The Microsoft [[explore>Encarta]] encyclopedia CD-ROM experience in the 1990's. [{{ :encarta_1.png?direct|[[explore>Encarta]] screenshot}}]

  * The children and adolescents I work with as a teacher at the [[https://spirare.org|Spirare]] organization for gifted children.

  * The large free software, open content and the web developer community (endless creativity and innovation).

  * The beauty and complexity of nature, culture and mathematics.

===== application layout =====

[{{ :app_layout.jpg?direct|application layout}}]

On **large-screen devices** (such as laptops and desktops computers), layout of Conzept consists of two main areas:
  * The **[[#conzept sidebar|sidebar]]** ("core app"), which is used for showing the [[#string search|search interface]], the language selection and various tabs.

  * The **content area**, which consists of one or two **[[#content panes]]**. These panes are used to show [[apps|apps]] and (embeddable) websites.

On **small-screen devices** (such as mobile phones) the layout is different:
  * The sidebar and the two content-panes are each on their own page.
  * To move between panes, you tap the blue buttons on the bottom of the screen. For some apps swiping left / right is enabled also. (Note: This swiping is disabled on the sidebar page, to allow for more specific swiping actions on that page.)

==== conzept sidebar ====

[{{ :sidebar_screenshot_1.jpg?direct|sidebar example }}]

From the sidebar you can:

  * Click on the "conzept" name, to **clear the search query and return to the homescreen.** On the homescreen there are also various interesting topical-links available.

  * <html><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i>&nbsp;</html> **Change the content language** to any of the ~300 Wikipedia-supported languages.

  * <html><i class="fas fa-search"></i>&nbsp;</html> **Enter a [[#string_search|search string]], [[#structured_search|structured search query]] or a [[#commands|command]].**

  * <html><i class="fas fa-stream"></i>&nbsp;</html> **Browse the search results** in the topics-tab.
    * More [[terms#topic_card|topics]] will be loaded in the sidebar as you scroll down to the bottom of the search results.

  * <html><i class="far fa-sticky-note"></i></html> **Manage your [[#bookmarks|bookmarks]]** in the bookmarks-tab
    * This allows for quick access to previously bookmarked topics.

   * <html><i class="far fa-bookmark"></i>&nbsp;</html> **Add an URL-bookmark** to your bookmarks. This creates a URL-bookmark of the app view-state, not a topic bookmark.
     * Note: A topical bookmark can be created by going into the topic-card and then clicking the bookmarking-icon.

  * <html><i class="fas fa-wrench"></i>&nbsp;</html> **Use additional tools** from the tools-tab, allowing you to:
    * Go to a random topic
    * Compare topics ([[https://conze.pt/explore/Trogon?l=en&t=compare&c=Q1268064,Q998535,Q1268477&s=true|example]])
    * Play ambient audio (which can help with focus)
    * Fullscreen the app
    * Bookmark the current URL
    * Clone the current tab

  * <html><i class="fas fa-cog"></i>&nbsp;</html> **Change the settings** in the [[#settings|settings-tab]].

  * <html><i class="fas fa-question"></i>&nbsp;</html> **See the documentation** in the help-tab.
    * Links to the user, administrator and developer guides.
    * List of supported keyboard shortcuts.
    * Various nnformation about Concept.

  * Control the sidebar presentation:
    * **Hide the sidebar** by clicking on the <html><i class="fas fa-angle-left"></i></html> icon.
    * **Resize the width of the sidebar**, by dragging the vertical separator line or the <html><i class="fas fa-grip-lines-vertical"></i></html> resize-handle
==== content panes ====

The content area can consist of one or two **content panes**, depending on the type of content being shown. **These panes are used to show [[apps|Conzept apps]] or (embeddable) websites.**

Some types of content (such as highly inter-related information displaying apps) can sometimes be presented better in a dual-pane view. Such a view can make it easier to browse lots of related objects. without losing the 'main thread'.

**The general workflow of these panes is always from left-to-right. So the sidebar directs the content pane.** If the content area has two content panes, the left pane will direct the right pane.

Philosophically speaking, a single content-pane view is a sort of **1st-degree presentation** (concept => concept relation detail), while a dual content-pane view is a **2nd-degree presentation** (concept => concept relations overview => concept relation details). 

Some embedded apps have a  2nd-degree presention inside of a single-pane (eg. the map app through a modal popup). Simply having 1st and 2nd-degree presentations can cover most information relations quite well, while still limiting the cognitive load and view-management efforts of the user. 
===== string search =====

{{ :autocomplete.png?direct|search autocomplete-suggestions}}

To find topics of your interest, you can enter a search string into the search bar.
While typing your string you will get back topic suggestions.

You can either select a topic suggestion or use your own search string.

To search for **literal phrases**, you can put double-quotes around your search terms (eg. "[[https://conze.pt/explore/%22Venetian%20history%22?l=en&ds=reference&t=string&s=true#|Venetian history]]").

The results will be shown in the sidebar and the next results are loaded once you scroll to the bottom of the results.

If your search-string does not directly match any Wikipedia article, there will be a [[terms#topic_card|topic card]] created from that "raw" search-string. This card will however lack all the Wikidata-related [[terms#topic_fields|topic fields]].

===== search options =====

[{{ ::search_options_001.jpg?direct| search options ([[https://conze.pt/explore/geography?l=en&d=openlibrary&t=string&filterby=text&sortby=relevance-desc&datemin=2005-06-14&datemax=2006-01-01&theme=lattice&s=true#|link]]) }}]

The term-based searching can be augmented with various **search options**, to filter and sort the results further.

Note that not all these search-options are supported by all [[datasources]], most datasources only implement a limited set.
So when you set these search-options, be aware that the options you set will not always be reflected in the search results (for some datasources).

Below are the available search options.

==== search in ====

The **search in** option allow you to set the **category of datasource sets** to search in. "Datasource sets" are groups of similar datasources.

Note: When you toggle an individual datasource in the settings-menu, the category set in this option will be de-selected.

The following categories are currently available:
  * Reference works
  * Culture (GLAM data)
  * Science
  * Business (including government and corruption data)
  * Legal
  * News
  * Media
  * Web

==== filter by ====

**Filter by** media-type:
  * Text (article, book, PDF, etc.)
  * Image
  * Video
  * Audio
  * 3D (object models, or pictures of 3D objects)
  * Entity (organizations, people, etc. Note: This might be split up later into sub-types)
  * Software
  * Archive (zip file, mixed-media collections)
  * Data (CSV, JSON, etc. )

==== date range ====

**Date-range filter**: from start-date to end-date. Both dates //must// be entered for this search-option to be active!

Notes: Most datasources don't (yet) support date-range searches, but sometimes support a more limited date filter.
  * Full support: Europeana.
  * Semi support:
    * Rijksmuseum (uses century of the start-date)
    * OpenLibrary (uses the start-date as the "first_publish_year")
  * All the other datasources have no date-range support.
  * Datasources to be determined / implemented: Wikipedia, Wikidata, Library of Congress, ...
  * OpenAlex supports date-range search, but this feature requires a paid subscription.
  * Currently the start/end date-range refer to the "creation" or "event" date of datasource items. In the future an option may be added to use other date-range item attributes (also depends on the broader datasource support for this search functionality).

==== near ====

The **near** option allows you to search by geolocation and country using a 3D globe popup.
The country is automatically inferred based on the geolocation or can be selected directly through the country-selection-mode.

Most datasources dont (yet) support geolocation-based searching, but these datasources currently do:
  * Europeana
  * OpenAlex (only by country)
  * GLEIF (only by country)

==== sort by ====

**Sort by** (in either the descending "↓" and ascending "↑" direction):
  * Relevance
  * Date (of creation, or the most relevant date-related attribute of the datasource)
  * Update
  * Random
  * Title
  * Citations (or some similar available "reference" count)
  * Title
  * Distance

==== batch size ====

The **batch size** indicates the maximum amount of results to fetch per page, for each datasource.

===== structured search =====

[{{ ::structured_query_1.jpg?direct|structured search query}}]

[{{ ::structured_query_2.jpg?direct|structured query results ([[https://conze.pt/explore/?l=en&t=wikipedia&s=true&query=%7B%22conditions%22%3A%5B%7B%22propertyId%22%3A%22P31%22%2C%22propertyDataType%22%3A%22wikibase-item%22%2C%22propertyValueRelation%22%3A%22matching%22%2C%22referenceRelation%22%3A%22regardless%22%2C%22value%22%3A%22Q5%22%2C%22subclasses%22%3Atrue%2C%22conditionRelation%22%3Anull%2C%22negate%22%3Afalse%7D%2C%7B%22propertyId%22%3A%22P106%22%2C%22propertyDataType%22%3A%22wikibase-item%22%2C%22propertyValueRelation%22%3A%22matching%22%2C%22referenceRelation%22%3A%22regardless%22%2C%22value%22%3A%22Q36834%22%2C%22subclasses%22%3Atrue%2C%22conditionRelation%22%3A%22and%22%2C%22negate%22%3Afalse%7D%5D%2C%22limit%22%3A10%2C%22useLimit%22%3Atrue%2C%22omitLabels%22%3Afalse%7D|link]]) }}]

Structured searching is an easy way to **construct basic Wikidata [[explore>SPARQL]]-queries** and see the topic results in the sidebar. Only the Wikidata SPARQL-endpoint is supported for now.

Structured search can be accessed by:

  - Enabling this feature by going to the **settings menu** tab -> **features** and then click enable **structured search**. \\ \\
  - Then go to the "structured search" detail-element in the topics-tab. \\ \\
  - Here you can define one or more sets of a requested **entity class** and/or an **[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Database_reports/List_of_properties/all|entity property]]** value. \\ \\
  - Click the "run query" button. \\ \\


[ TODO: Describe the structured-query output options: sidebar topics, 2D, 3D, timeline, etc. ]

===== geospatial search =====

[{{ ::geospatial_search_1.jpg?direct|geospatial search query (TODO: example link) }}]

Geospatial searching is a way to easily **construct geo-coordinate-bound queries** and see the locational topic results in the sidebar. Currently only Wikidata is supported.

This feature can be enabled through: **settings menu** -> **features** -> enable **geospatial search**.

===== AI chat =====

[{{ ::ai_chat_1.jpg?direct|AI chat interface}}]

The AI-chat app functionality allows the user to ask natural-language questions and see an AI chatbot answer.
The answer text may contain linked words. When these words are clicked a new sidebar topic query is created.

This feature can be enabled through: **settings menu** -> **features** -> **AI search**.

Note that the AI-chat feature requires filling in your OpenAI key at **settings menu** -> **API keys** -> **OpenAI**. This key is only stored locally in your browser.

===== topic presentations =====

[{{ ::presentation_001.jpg?direct|auto-generated topic presentation ([[https://conze.pt/explore?l=en&d=wikipedia,wikidata&t=presentation&i=Q36534#|link]]) }}]

The topic-cards with a Wikidata-Qid and a classification, show a link to the topic presentation. The presentation is accompanied by a spoken version of the Wikipedia article. You can select other sections to be spoken or pause/resume/stop the Text-to-Speech at any time.

Using the (LISP-Scheme based) **[[command API]]** it is possible to auto-generated topic-presentations.

Presentation can be created from either a [[https://conze.pt/explore?l=en&d=wikipedia,wikidata&t=presentation&i=Q362#|Wikidata Qid]] or from a [[https://conze.pt/explore/World%20War%20II?l=en&d=wikipedia,wikidata&t=presentation#|title-string]].

===== search commands =====

These are "**!**"-prefixed command-words which can change the normal search behavior, into some other defined action. So instead of doing a search for the plain-string, a search-command can do a special action.

The following search-commands are currently supported:
  * **[[https://conze.pt/explore/Retrieval-augmented%20generation?l=en&ds=reference&t=string#|!show]]**, AI "retrieval augmented"  search system (based on the OpenAI "gpt-4o-mini" inference model). This allows you to ask for "sets of topics" in natural language (with multi-lingual support), and get back results mapped onto Wikidata/Wikipea and raw-string topic cards. (Note: This requires you to enter your OpenAI API-key in the chat app config menu. This key is only stored locally in your browser.) \\ \\
  * **[[https://conze.pt/explore/!chat%20branches%20of%20civil%20engineering?l=en#|!chat]]**, AI chat system (based on OpenAI chatGPT (Note: This requires you to enter your OpenAI API-key in the chat app config menu. This key is only stored locally in your browser.) \\ \\
  * **[[https://conze.pt/explore/!graph%20y=x*x?l=en&d=wikipedia,wikidata&t=link&u=https%3A%2F%2Fjoshs-graphing-calculator.vercel.app%2Fapp%23%25257B%252522items%252522%25253A%25255B%25257B%252522id%252522%25253A0%25252C%252522visible%252522%25253Atrue%25252C%252522type%252522%25253A%252522Equation%252522%25252C%252522latex%252522%25253A%252522y%25253Dx*x%252522%25252C%252522color%252522%25253A%252522red%252522%25257D%25255D%25252C%252522variables%252522%25253A%25255B%25255D%25252C%252522slices%252522%25253A%25255B%25255D%25257D&s=true#|!graph]]**, 2D/3D function plotter), ([[https://github.com/PullJosh/graphing-calculator|graphing-calculator]], [[https://github.com/PullJosh/graphing-calculator/blob/main/package.json|ISC]])

See also the **[[command API]]**, which is the future of Conzept command scripting and presentations. The above search-command-words can also be used in the command API.

===== bookmarks =====

[{{ ::bookmark_1.jpg?direct|adding a bookmark}}]

[{{ ::bookmark_2.jpg?direct|bookmark management from the bookmark-tab}}]

==== add bookmark ====

You can **bookmark topics** that you like, by opening the "main"-section of a topic, and then clicking on the <html>&nbsp;<i class="far fa-bookmark"></i>&nbsp;</html> icon.

To **see and manage your bookmarks**, click on the <html>&nbsp;<i class="far fa-bookmark"></i>&nbsp;</html> icon in the tab-menu.
From the bookmark manager you can delete and drag-and-drop the bookmarks into your own list hierarchies.

The bookmarks are only stored locally in the browser (using a browser cookie), and not on any server.

Bookmarks can also be added manually using the "add bookmark" form.

==== import bookmarks ====

  * Your bookmarks can be **imported and exported as a JSON file.** This is currently the only option to share bookmarks between devices and browsers.

==== export bookmarks ====

  * Your bookmarks can be **exported to several external formats**: HTML, KML (for geo-apps), GPX (for geo-apps). Note: these formats export any tree-hierarchy to a flat structure.

==== bookmark selection actions ====

(TODO)

===== settings =====

[{{::settings.jpg?direct|settings tab}}]

The following settings are available: (TODO)

==== datasources ====

[{{::datasources.png?direct|datasource options}}]

Here you can individually set the active **[[datasources]]**.

The search interface provides a more general datasources selection method, by allowing selection of sets of datasources in a certain category ("reference works", "culture", "science", etc.).

Note that (un)selecting any individual datasources, while the datasource-set selection of the search interface.

==== font size ====

  * Set the **font size**

==== font type ====

  * Set the **font type**

==== theme ====

  * Set the **theme** (light / dark mode, grid / no-grid sidebar layout, link previews)

==== features ====

  * geo-search

  * AI chat

==== reading assistence ====

  * Set **reading-help** options (word-start bolding, color filters)

==== interface language ====

  * Set the **interface language** (locale)
    * Note: This is different from the content-language setting. This //only// affects the Conzept UI interface.

==== persona ====

  * Set **persona info** \\ \\
    * **AI tutor style** for the AI chat system. This sets up a different system-role context (example: historian, scientist, storyteller). \\ \\ When the "auto-select" tutor is chosen, Conzept will automatically derive the best suited tutor for a topic, based on its classification. \\ \\ To use the AI chat, make sure you enter an OpenAI key in the chat app settings-menu first. Note that this key is only stored locally in your browser, for safety reasons.\\ \\
    * **Country** (automatically derived from your browser-locale, but can be changed). This allows Conzept to show country-specific links for topics. \\ \\
    * **Interest** tags. This allows Conzept to better suit the user-interface to your needs. Eg. to show map links for hotels and walking-routes, with the tourist-tag.

==== voice ====

  * Set **text-to-speech** settings (voice, speaking speed, speaking rate, auto-speak)

  * The **autospeak** option allows Conzept to signal to embedded apps that their content can be spoken automatically. (Currently only supported by the "AI chat app".)
