====== terms ======

Here is a list of the most important terms used in the Conzept system.

===== topic card =====

[{{ ::topic-card.jpg?direct|topic card}}]

The [[user_manual#search_results|search results]] are rendered in the [[user_manual#conzept_sidebar|sidebar]] as a scrollable list of **topic cards**.

These topic cards are a container for all information about a topic, including:
  * Title
  * [[#topic_headline|Headline]] (showing the topic's classification and the most essential links and info)
  * Subtitle
  * Description
  * Thumbnail
  * Text-to-speech control buttons
  * A hierarchy of unfoldable [[#topic_sections|sections]] with section links (click on the <html>&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-play"></i>&nbsp;</html> icon to see them)


===== topic headline =====

The topic headline shows the most essential links and info (if available / applicable), such as:

  * The classification of the object (the first icon with a blue-background).
    * Note: For certain topic-types the class-icon is clickable, and will result in submitting a [[user_manual#structured_search|structured query]] for "same type" objects.
  * Start and end year
  * Category-tree link
  * And many other links: website, maps, video, twitter, etc.

===== topic sections =====

The main idea behind Conzept is to help you **see topics of interest from different viewpoints**.

These are some of the available viewpoints in the Conzept encyclopedia:
  * Wikidata information
  * Video / audio / image archives
  * Digital books
  * Science papers
  * Museum archives
  * Historic archives (such as newspapers)
  * Educational materials
  * Maps
  * Social media
  * Meta-relations (similar topics, comparisons, article link graphs)
  * and more...

**On Conzept these viewpoints are the topic-sections and the links they contain.**

Not all these viewpoints are relevant all the time for topics ofcourse. In some cases Conzept can hide sections or show extra sections automatically, depending on a certain context.

Note: The section and field structures can be customized by editing the [[section customization|section file]] and the [[field customization|fields file]].

[ Experimental: You can configure some of this context with the "persona-tags" setting. For example: If you have a "nomad" persona tag, you will see a link to walking routes in the topic-headline, when viewing a location topic. If you have a tourist-persona tag, then you will see a link to hotel locations. ]

===== topic fields =====

[{{ ::section-fields-1.jpg?direct|main-section fields}}]

Each [[terms#topic_sections|section]] of a [[terms#topic_card|topic]] can be populated by links. \\
(Note: these can also be a plain string or some non-link HTML. In Conzept we call these elements "fields".)

When a user clicks on such a link, it can trigger several kinds of [[field_customization#introduction|actions]].
