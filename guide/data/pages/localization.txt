====== localization ======

[{{ ::german_view.jpg?direct|Conzept in German}}]

Most of the Conzept interface can be localized, these parts include the main UI elements, such as menu-labels and the [[terms#topic_card|topic-card]] section-names.

Conzept also has basic support for right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic.

The list of supported locales can be found in the Conzept settings file ("CONZEPT_LOCALES" setting).

To add a new locale to Conzept, follow these steps:

  - **Add the locale to the "CONZEPT_LOCALES" setting** in the Conzept settings file. \\ \\
  - **Add a the new locale file** to the "[[https://github.com/waldenn/conzept/tree/master/app/explore2/assets/i18n|app/explore2/assets/i18n]]" directory.
    * Note: The easiest way to do this is to copy the [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/waldenn/conzept/master/app/explore2/assets/i18n/conzept-en.json|english]] locale to your new locale file and then make the translation changes needed for that locale. \\ \\
  - For **automated translation** of this file into any language, run the JSON text through the **[[https://translate.i18next.com/|translate.i18next.com]]** service.
  - Run "**npm run build**" to rebuild Conzept.

On the Conzept encyclopedia website the following locales are currently supported: ar, ceb, de, en, es, fr, hi, it, ja, nl, pt, ru, sv, zh, uk, bn, id, ur, mr, te, tr, ta, ko, vi, ha, fa, sw, da, no, bn, ca, sr, fi, hu, cs, hr.
