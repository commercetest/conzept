====== adding new Wikidata properties ======

Conzept currently supports all these [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Database_reports/List_of_properties/all|Wikidata property classes]]: **WikibaseItem**, **ExternalId**, **Url**, **String** and **Quantity**.

Only part of the following Wikidata classes are currently used on Conzept:  **CommonsMedia**, **GlobeCoordinate**. These fields often require manual integration for their proper use in the Conzept UI.

As new fields are frequently added to Wikidata, Conzept has some [[https://github.com/waldenn/conzept/tree/master/app/explore2/tools|tooling]] to easily collect these new properties and integrate them properly.
===== process =====

To add new Wikidata property fields to the Conzept fields, use the following process:

  * First **fetch all Wikidata properties** by executing the following script (located in the "app/explore2/tools" directory). The output is a "wikidata_properties.json" file. <code>./wikidata_properties_fetch.sh</code>

  * **Create the new Conzept fields** by running the "json2fields" script (also located in the "tools" directory).
    * Notes:
      * The command structure is: node json2fields.js "[PROPERTIES-FILE.json]" [PROPERTY-CLASS] > /tmp/output.txt
      * You can run the script for each of the property-classes: WikibaseItem, ExternalId, Url, GlobeCoordinate, CommonsMedia, String, Quantity.
      * The script will skip any Wikidata-fields which are already defined (by property number), so no duplicates are ever created).
    * Example: <code>node json2fields.js "wikidata_properties.json" WikibaseItem > /tmp/new_fields.txt</code>

  * **Include/merge the new property-class content** of "/tmp/new_fields.txt" file into the "conzept_fields"-variable of "src/data/fields.js". 
    * Note: With the Vim-editor this can be done as: ":r /tmp/new_fields.txt"

  * **Upgrade the Conzept version and rebuild**: <code>sudo vi /etc/conzept/settings.conf</code> <code>npm run build</code>
