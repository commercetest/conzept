====== roadmap ======

  * Fix the items mentioned in **[[issues|issues]]**.

===== datasources =====

  * Implement async wikidata-enriching (partly done)

  * More control over how datasources are used, with toggle-switches for:
    * datasource is active
      * datasource autocomplete
      * datasource searching

  * New search modalitites:
    * design the workflow
    * candidates:
      * geospatial search (almost done)
        * Issue: URL-serialization not working correctly
      * temporal-range search (point-in-time, start-time, end-time)
      * ISBN search
      * DOI search
      * structured search using SPARQL (beyond Wikidata)
        * ontology classes
        * ontology properties
        * autocompletion
        * multi-lingual labels
        * handle CORS issues

  * Improve existing search modalities:
    * ? Wikidata: Allow for filtering by raw-text-strings in "structured search" (currently not supported in the Wikidata-query-builder)
    * Wikidata: Add **claim-support** to the Wikidata-data fetching (and support for claim-data in the field-definitions).

  * Candidate new search-in datasource-sets:
    * news
    * jobs
    * health
    * mobility
    * education
    * wisdom / spirituality
    * youtube (requires approval)

===== frontend ideas =====

  * **Bookmarking**:
    * Cross-tab bookmark state-syncing
    * Allow for bookmarking presentations
    * Bookmark edit mode -> then click on bookmark -> display bookmark edit modal -> save button
    * Better generic data support, based on the "item data object"
    * Add more input-formats:
      * images (experimental support)
      * drawings (using tldraw or excalidraw)
      * speech-to-text transcript ([[https://github.com/LittlePath/live-transcript|webcomponent]])
      * audio ([[https://github.com/LittlePath/audio-recorder|webcomponent]])
      * video ([[https://github.com/LittlePath/video-recorder|webcomponent]])
      * longer notes
      * ? PDF
    * Research better drag-and-drop support

  * Look into using more webcomponents:
    * [[https://shoelace.style|Shoelace webcomponent system]]
    * [[https://design-system.w3.org/|W3C design system]]
    * [[https://component.gallery/|component.gallery]] (overview of webcomponents)

  * Add optional **geolocation-support**, so we could route a user from the current location to the location of a topic, using the [[https://twitter.com/conzept__/status/1490300622360518663|OSMR routing app]]. See also: [[https://github.com/jamealg/KT-companion|offline hiking-maps app]]

  * Find and integrate a **more lightweight MIDI-webcomponent**, if available ([[https://github.com/cifkao/html-midi-player|html-midi-player]] is more than 0.5MB by itself!)

  * JSON-LD enhancement: "Add schema:about properties that include #Wikidata (/entity/{id}) and #DBpedia (/resource/{id}) identifiers as property values." [[https://twitter.com/kidehen/status/1565006013350248449|*]] (this is useful when there are multiple subjects, beyond the main subject)

===== admin-dev workflows =====

  * Improve the workflow for adding [[datasources]].

  * Improve the workflow for adding [[integrating_an_api|API integrations]].

  * Clean up any issues with field definitions:
    * Turn the the inline-API field-structure into an object (instead of a string)?

  * Field-translation support: Create a structure to store field-label translations (title and icon-title), both for Wikidata and non-Wikidata fields.
    * Allow the [[adding_new_wikidata_properties|json2fields]] script to fetch and store property translations too.

  * Add a test-framework -> start adding tests for the most essential / complex code parts

  * How to detect if the field URL could be embedded (instead of opening a a new tab)? (run a headless browser loading an iframe with the URL, checking for CORS-errors?)

===== presentation ideas =====

  * Allow for extra Text-to-Speech (TTS) storylines around a topic (beyond Wikipedia articles). 
    * Related books, science articles, ...? 

  * UI for creating and sharing user-created presentations around a topic.
    * Allow for bookmarking presentations

===== educational-support enhancements  =====

  * **Collaborative & social learning** features:
    * shared audio and chat (eg. [[https://github.com/lyricat/mornin.fm|p2p audio-chat]] and [[https://www.hyperhyperspace.org/|text-chat]] rooms for each topic)
  * **Quizzing**: Auto-generated, [[https://fs.blog/spacing-effect/|spaced-repetition]]-based facts learning (for a certain topic / set of topics / topic-domain)
  * **Experiencing / Simulating**: eg. play Chess positions (done), ...
  * ? Note-taking integration  (eg.: [[https://bangle.io/|Bangle]], ...)
  * Better ways to indicate personal and professional interests (similar to the persona-tags setting)

===== general ideas =====

  * Conzept development vision:
    * **data-defined software**. Often this first requires several code implementations/examples to explore the domain.
    * Improve and maintain **conceptual integrity** (as vague and abstract as that term is).

  * ? Offline(-first) support with content-caching (especially useful when traveling and/or without reliable internet-connectivity).
    * Example apps: [[https://github.com/jamealg/KT-companion|hiking-map app]]

  * ? Research creating some kind of a simple web-application interface standard for input/output/event-handling:
    * URL parameter IO (iso2 language, search-string, ID, ...)
    * Event-handling (other view triggers, key-bindings, fullscreening, ...)

  * ? [[https://github.com/sebferre/sparklis|Sparklis]] / [[https://github.com/epoz/shmarql|shmarql]] -> needs CORS-issue workaround
    * [[http://www.irisa.fr/LIS/ferre/sparklis/examples.html|NLP query examples]]
    * sparql-endpoint testing: [[https://conze.pt/explore/?l=en&t=&s=true&query={%22conditions%22:[{%22propertyId%22:%22P5305%22,%22propertyDataType%22:%22url%22,%22propertyValueRelation%22:%22regardless-of-value%22,%22referenceRelation%22:%22regardless%22,%22value%22:%22%22,%22subclasses%22:false,%22conditionRelation%22:null,%22negate%22:false}],%22limit%22:10,%22useLimit%22:true,%22omitLabels%22:false}|query all endpoints]] (note: some endpoints are dead) -> then open "sparql explorer 2" in the main-section 
    * Handle HTTP GET/POST CORS issues with the SPARQL-endpoints (not sure POST is supported in the current Conzept proxy-service)
    * build steps [[https://github.com/sebferre/sparklis/issues/9#issuecomment-1018673156|here]]
