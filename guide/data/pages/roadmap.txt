====== roadmap ======

===== frontend ideas =====

  * Fix the items mentioned in **[[issues|issues]]**.

  * Add **claim-support** to the Wikidata-data fetching (and support for claim-data in the field-definitions).

  * **Bookmarking**:
    * Cross-tab bookmark state-syncing
    * Better generic data support, based on the "item data object"

  * Add optional **geolocation-support**, so we could route a user from the current location to the location of a topic, using the [[https://twitter.com/conzept__/status/1490300622360518663|OSMR routing app]]. See also: [[https://github.com/jamealg/KT-companion|offline hiking-maps app]]

===== admin-dev workflows =====

  * Improve the workflow for adding [[integrating_an_api|API integrations]].

  * Improve the workflow for adding [[datasources]].

  * Clean up any issues with field definitions:
    * Turn the the inline-API field-structure into an object (instead of a string)?

  * Field-translation support: Create a structure to store field-label translations (title and icon-title), both for Wikidata and non-Wikidata fields.
    * Allow the [[adding_new_wikidata_properties|json2fields]] script to fetch and store property translations too.

===== general ideas =====

  * Conzept development vision:
    * **data-define software** - rather than code-define - when possible. Often this first requires several code implementations/examples to explore the domain.
    * Improve and maintain **conceptual integrity**, as vague and abstract as that term is.

  * Research **educational-support enhancements**:
    * Collaborative & social learning features (eg. [[https://github.com/lyricat/mornin.fm|p2p audio-chat]] and [[https://www.hyperhyperspace.org/|text-chat]] rooms for each topic)
    * User-created and auto-generated presentations around a topic
    * Auto-generated topic [[https://conze.pt/explore/Genre?l=en&t=link&i=Q483394&u=https%3A%2F%2Fconze.pt%2Fapp%2Fquiz%2F%3Fm%3Dlist%26q%3DQ3305213%26p%3DP136%26l%3Den&s=true|quizzes]]
    * Auto-generated, [[https://fs.blog/spacing-effect/|spaced-repetition]]-based facts learning (for a certain topic / set of topics / topic-domain)
    * ? Note-taking integration  (eg.: [[https://bangle.io/|Bangle]], ...)
    * Better ways to indicate personal and professional interests (similar to the persona-tags setting)
    * Experiences: play Chess positions (done), ...

  * **Multi-modal bookmarks**:
    * Formats:
      * Image (including self-drawn using: tldraw or excalidraw)
      * Audio (music, nature sounds, speech)
      * DOI
      * ISBN
      * Custom text notes
    * Connect these bookmark-types to new actions (eg: find similar images, detect plant type, perform speech-to-text, ...)

  * **structured search (beyond Wikidata)**
    * ontology classes
    * ontology properties
    * autocompletion
    * multi-lingual labels
    * handle CORS issues

  * Look into using more webcomponents:
    * [[https://design-system.w3.org/|W3C design system]]
    * [[https://component.gallery/|component.gallery]] (overview of webcomponents)

  * ? Offline(-first) support with content-caching (especially useful when traveling and/or without reliable internet-connectivity).
    * Example apps: [[https://github.com/jamealg/KT-companion|hiking-map app]]

  * ? Research creating some kind of a simple web-application interface standard for input/output/event-handling:
    * URL parameter IO (iso2 language, search-string, ID, ...)
    * Event-handling (other view triggers, key-bindings, fullscreening, ...)

  * ? [[https://github.com/sebferre/sparklis|Sparklis]] / [[https://github.com/epoz/shmarql|shmarql]] -> needs CORS-issue workaround
    * [[http://www.irisa.fr/LIS/ferre/sparklis/examples.html|NLP query examples]]
    * sparql-endpoint testing: [[https://conze.pt/explore/?l=en&t=&s=true&query={%22conditions%22:[{%22propertyId%22:%22P5305%22,%22propertyDataType%22:%22url%22,%22propertyValueRelation%22:%22regardless-of-value%22,%22referenceRelation%22:%22regardless%22,%22value%22:%22%22,%22subclasses%22:false,%22conditionRelation%22:null,%22negate%22:false}],%22limit%22:10,%22useLimit%22:true,%22omitLabels%22:false}|query all endpoints]] (note: some endpoints are dead) -> then open "sparql explorer 2" in the main-section 
    * Handle HTTP GET/POST CORS issues with the SPARQL-endpoints (not sure POST is supported in the current Conzept proxy-service)
    * build steps [[https://github.com/sebferre/sparklis/issues/9#issuecomment-1018673156|here]]
    * See also: **[[https://open-source.pages.logilab.fr/SemWeb/sparqlexplorer/?endpoint=https%253A%252F%252Fldf.fi%252Fmufi%252Fsparql|SparqlExplorer]]**

===== various =====

  * How to detect if the field URL could be embedded (instead of opening a a new tab)? (run a headless browser loading an iframe with the URL, checking for CORS-errors?)

  * JSON-LD enhancement: "Add schema:about properties that include #Wikidata (/entity/{id}) and #DBpedia (/resource/{id}) identifiers as property values." [[https://twitter.com/kidehen/status/1565006013350248449|*]] (this is useful when there are multiple subjects, beyond the main subject)

  * Find and integrate a **more lightweight MIDI-webcomponent**, if available ([[https://github.com/cifkao/html-midi-player|html-midi-player]] is more than 0.5MB by itself!)
