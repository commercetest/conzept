  * Main frontend AI goals:
    * [[https://conze.pt/explore/Retrieval-augmented%20generation?l=en&ds=reference|Retrieval-augmented generation]] (implemented, see [[https://conze.pt/explore/!show%20highest%20monuments%20in%20Southern%20Europe?l=en&ds=reference|example query]] - requires setting your OpenAI key)
    * Topical expositions
    * Topical question-answering
    * Topical quizzing & examination
    * Content summarization and Q&A of larger texts (including PDFs)
    * Bookmark-selection 'reasoning' over one or more topics (implemented, more to do)
    * Presentation augmentation (combined with TTS)
    * LLM-using application parametrization/generation, which can use over one or more bookmark topics. (artifict creation)


Conzept's current vision for frontend [[explore>Large language model|LLM]], is to enhance and combine the strengths of these two search contexts: 

  * **Semantic search** - Due to using clear graph "entities" (regardless of language), the semantic web context is __often more rigid / safe / predictable / cheaper / faster / multi-lingual / correct / precise__, than Vector-based searches.

  * **Keyword / phrase based Vector-search** - this textual AI context is __often more flexible, fluid and creative__, than semantic-web style search context, but also requires a lot more compute and can/will hallucinate.

If one aims for a [[explore>Neuro-symbolic AI|neuro-symbolic]] ("NeSy") synthesis of LLM functions and semantic entities, each topic can have a clear context, upon which you can start prompting the AI for the preferred action/intention.

See also the "structured LLM prompt" screenshot on the right, for an experiment of this. No text was typed by the user, the user only selected a bookmark, to be used with some AI-based reasoning function. This makes it possible to:
  * Categorize the topics based on their bookmark meta-data. Based on the main and sub-tag and other special data-attributes.
  * Combine multiple topics for a specific LLM-prompt. Eg. show a combined organism occurence map (for each topic with a GBIF ID). 
  * Make the LLM-prompting multi-lingual.

  * **[[https://conze.pt/app/web-llm-chat/out/|web-llm-chat]]** will be the main Conzept LLM app integration in the future.
    * This integration is a **work in progress** (to replace the current, simple [[https://conze.pt/explore/Neuro-symbolic%20AI?l=en&d=wikipedia&t=link-split&batchsize=5&i=Q113512183&u=%2Fapp%2Fchat%2F%3Fm%3DNeuro-symbolic%2520AI%26l%3Den%26t%3Dexaminator%26autospeak%3Dtrue&s=true#|AI chat app]])
      * Current status: Self-hosting is working, TODOs:
        * Get a laptop with support for WebGPU and enough VRAM to run good models.
        * URL parameter context (system + user prompt)
        * Implement TTS and SpeechInput (as implemented in the current AI chat app)
        * Port over the current system-prompts.
    * Most required features:
     * Fully client-side
      * ✓ WebGPU based (too slow otherwise)
      * ✓ Multi-lingual ([[https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm-chat/issues/48|support added]], but may still need some locale data)
      * ✓ Multi-model (so both smaller/slower and larger/faster systems can be supported)
      * ❌ Multi-modal (Not yet supported! Later other modalities, such as PDFs, audio and images should be usable.).
    * Code:
      * [[https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm-chat|repo]]
      * [[https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm|web-llm]] (core framework)
    * Advantages of client-side AI models:
      * Privacy
      * Opensource
      * Cheaper operation (after the initial hardware purchase)
      * No 3rd-party AI-provider account needed
      * No limits on AI-queries (both quantitative and qualitative)
      * Flexibility and freedom how and where to use these AI models in the future.

  * Furthermore the combination of: [[https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/rag|Retrieval Augmented Generation]] (RAG), a vector DB, and a LLM model, can also utilize the extra meta-data from a more grounded understanding of a topic .
    * Candidate expiriment RAG tools:
      * [[https://github.com/nico-martin/ask-my-pdf|Ask-my-PDF]] (RAG + Vector DB + LLM QA)
      * [[https://github.com/poloclub/mememo|Mememo]] (RAG + Vector DB)
    * Research how to integrate a (frontend) RAG-tool with Conzept
      * INPUT: PDF URL + user language -> RAG LLM UI
      * What about "plain text" inputs?
