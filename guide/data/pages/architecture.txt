======  architecture ======

The main architectural choices made in the Conzept application are:

  * **__Value the [[explore>user experience]] above all else__.** Keep things **simple**, **web native**, **live**, **accessible**, **[[https://calmtech.com|calm]]**, **performant** and **fun to code and maintain.**

  * Use **__embedded iframes__** (and self-hosted app URLs) as a form of very simple, well-isolated 'micro-services'. However, to the user Conzept should //feel// as one application. The benefits this simple composition mechanism brings, is very good compatibility with most of the web-tools already written and the ones still to be written!

  * The communication between Conzept and [[used_projects#embedded_apps|embedded apps]] is done using **__[[url_structure|URL-parameters]]__** (examples: title, entity ID, language code, URL) and **__postMessage() calls__**.
    * Note: Some styling of embedded apps is also applied by directly setting common CSS classes on the body-element of the iframe (such as the "dark" class for dark-mode styles, or the "rtl" class for right-to-left language-scripts).

  * Use **__declarative data definitions__** where possible (examples: [[section_customization|sections]], [[field_customization|fields]], topic headlines, [[topic_classification|topic tags and indicators]]). Avoid code duplication where possible, instead use use expressive data structures parsed by minimal code. Editing textual data-structures is also a lot easier than editing code. This approach also allows for text-tools to automate some of these tasks.

  * **Use vanilla JS** (avoid complex [[https://catonmat.net/frameworks-dont-make-sense|frameworks]] inverting control), with jQuery (or plain JS) for managing the DOM.
    * jQuery - and the jQuery-dependent plugins - may be removed or replaced in the future, if possible and beneficial.
    * When needed: use [[explore>WebAssembly]] for performance-demanding, compute parts in the code.
    * If some (relatively complex) HTML-widget needs to be used in many different places: consider creating a **[[explore>Web Components|web component]]**. This was done for the [[apps#organism_occurrence_map|organism occurrence map]].

  * Main types of data-types to use: **plain strings, URLs, entity ID's, JSON and lists of JavaScript objects.**

  * Allow the **safe use of [[explore>Eval|eval()]]** needed for flexible [[field_customization|field definitions]]. This is safe, as only the admins/devs can update the field definitions. Conzept is also a mainly client-side application, with no user-data being stored on the server.
