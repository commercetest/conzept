# Conzept

Conzept is an attempt to create a flexible **topic exploration system for the 21st century**. A free ([GPL](https://github.com/waldenn/conzept/blob/master/LICENSE) licensed) semantic tool, that can use any REST and SPARQL based datasource.

Client-side topic-classification in addition allows for a fast, higher-level logic throughout the whole user experience. Conzept also has an uniquely integrated user-interface, which gives you a single well-designed view of all this information (in any of the 300+ Wikipedia languages), with less cognitive load.

This project has been funded by the [NLnet Foundation](https://nlnet.nl/project/Conzept/) (backed by the [NGI4eu](https://www.ngi.eu/) and [EU Council](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/european-council/) vision and funds). Thank you for this support!
