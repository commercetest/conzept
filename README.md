# Conzept

Conzept is an attempt to create a flexible **topic exploration system for the 21st century**. A free ([GPL](https://github.com/waldenn/conzept/blob/master/LICENSE) licensed) tool, that can use any REST based datasource (or SPARQL - with fulltext-search support). Serving [custom JSON](https://conze.pt/guide/roadmap#backend_aihttps://conze.pt/guide/roadmap#backend_ai) datasources are a planned roadmap feature. Build for fun, education and research purposes. Conzep gives you an integrated, multi-lingual view of all this information. For more details, see the [documentation](https://conze.pt/guide/home).

This project has been funded by the [NLnet Foundation](https://nlnet.nl/project/Conzept/) (backed by the [NGI4eu](https://www.ngi.eu/) and [EU Council](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/european-council/) vision and funds). Thank you for this support! 

# Conzept encyclopedia

The online version called "[Conzept encyclopedia](https://conze.pt)" is based on: Wikipedia, Wikidata, the Open Library, Archive.org and many other information sources.

Conzept encyclopedia allows you to explore any of the millions of topics on Wikipedia from many different angles - such as science, art, digital books and education - both as a defined semantic entity ("a thing") as well as a string.
